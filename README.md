# Housing-price-prediction
## Abstract:
Due to lack of land availability in metro cities the current trend is to build high rises. This can handle the overpopulation issue also. Villa communities or gated communities are also very popular now a days. Depending upon various factors like main road access, parking facilities, building area and carpet area the price will be decided of that particular property. 
## Problem statement:
Build a ML model which can predict the property price of a given property depending upon various factors like BHK, number of bathrooms, furnishing type, parking availability, status, transaction, type and locality.
